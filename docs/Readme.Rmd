The material for the *R in HPC* course is provided in the following directories:
          
          * 0.Profiling
          * 1.Optimizing
          * 2.RAM
          * 3.MotivationHPC
          * 6.RF
          
Notes:
* Inside the directories (except for 6.RF), there is a markdown document (*.Rmd*) and the resulting *_lecture.html* document which I generated. We will use this *_lecture.html* document.
  During the course so you are not expected to compile the *.Rmd* files.

* Instead of compiling the *.Rmd* file, you can work on the corresponding *.R* file to execute parts of the code.

* For the Exercises, we provided you with templates for the functions. Here, you are expected to write your own code using this template.
  Exercises and their solutions can be found in the folders with the same names.
